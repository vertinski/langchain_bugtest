[Document(page_content="don't really want to have any more\ncurrency volatility here I'm gonna sell\nreserves and at the same time ease\ndomestically because I have the freedom\nto do that because I have so many\nreserves\num then that's exactly what they're\nstarting to do so you're now getting\nthat thing where the U.S has basically\nbecause of the denomination of energy\ncreated stress the dollars created\nstress for these countries and now\nthey're turning around and dealing with\nthat by selling dollar Assets in pretty\nmeaningful size so that just adds again\nto this liquidity hole that the FED is\nalready creating for dollar assets\nif you haven't seen the chart on balance\nof payments out there in Germany I urge\nyou to look it up it basically looks\nlike a Bitcoin job it's it's a nosedive\npretty interesting stuff happening this\nyear in in global macro and energy\nmarkets not least yeah but before I\nallow you to leave with me I I wanted to\nto have your take your finally on the\nsort of strategic ramifications for\nasset allocation if we get stickier\ninflation a weaker US dollar and\npotentially a slightly better\nperformance in develop sorry Emerging\nMarkets relative to developed markets\nwhat would be the ramifications for\nGlobal asset allocation Trends yeah so\nwith um you know with I could add a\nwhole bunch of detail around which\nemerging markets and how the best\nexpressions are and so on so but without\ngoing into that the world you've just\ndescribed is literally the exact\nopposite of how investors are positioned\nand how global market caps are comprised\nright there is more US dollar Assets in\nthe world than there ever has been\nbefore owned by foreigners than ever\nbefore that net you know live portfolio\nliability to the rest of the world is up\n20 points of U.S GDP just in the last 10\nyears so everyone has come into U.S\nbecause it had the pot it was the\nhighest yielding of all the major\ndeveloped currencies during the last\ncycle and on the tax side obviously it\nhad the best returns and so people chase\nthat so you're now in a situation where\nlike U.S stocks are about half of global\nmarket cap which is bigger than it's\never been even in 1929 and so there's\nlike an extreme imbalance there and on\nbecause of people coming in and buying\nthose assets and pushing them up the\ndollar itself as well is very elevated\nin real and nominal terms no matter how\nyou want to look at the currency\nevaluation there so of course foreigners\nwho have or even domestics although the\ndomestics won't notice the currency\nissue as much the foreigners who have\nbasically come running into these assets\nduration Assets in the U us that no\nmatter whether it's bonds or stocks are\ndown 20 to 30 percent this year and you\nknow to some degree they've got an unhed\ndollar position as well that at least is\nhelping them a little bit but dealing\nwith the the sort of at least partially\noffsetting the underperformance of U.S\nassets\num you know that that's a situation that\nis maximally painful for people if you\nactually need you know you've spent 20\nyears building up exposures to\ndisinflationary long duration assets\nwhich are exactly of course the opposite\nof what you want in a high inflation\nworld where the Dollar's falling and\nmore old economy sort of cash flow\nbusinesses are doing well and so on so I\nthink the first point would be\nfrom my standpoint I'm not like my bar\nfor holding any dollar asset at this\npoint is very high\num sometimes there's a credit trade or\nspreads blow out in some part of my\nspace that makes it worth it but by and\nlarge I don't want to be exposed to\nthese things that have benefited from\nthis 20 years of unconstrained liquidity\nthat's now inflecting\num and then I guess from a more you know\nlike let's say less tactical point of\nview you want to have things where they\nhave the ability to pass through\ninflation in earnings so you capture\nnominal GDP growth in the cash flows of\nwhatever asset you're going to be\nexposed to so inflation hedge assets\nCommodities stuff like that and you want\nthat thing to be cheap enough that it's\nnot going to derate on those cash flows\neither like it's got to start out so\ncheap and and you know not dependent on\nincremental liquidity that you like if\nthey can grow cash flows by 10 and not\nderate good you're going to get like a\nreasonable positive return in an\nenvironment of like pretty persistent\nchallenges for the bulk of global market\ncap whether it's bonds or stocks so I\nthink about you know cash flow\nprotection cheapness you know dependency\non liquidity Global diversification\nprobably being more value additive than\nit has been in the past when the US was\nlike the only game in town\num and sort of pivoting ahead of ahead\nof all of those changes because this is\nvery con like one cycle to the next you\nalways get this two to three year period\nwhere the last Cycle's assets just get\npriced to Perfection and like they're\ngonna extrapolate these Peak conditions\ninto infinity and then it's a slow you\nknow because asset returns are just a\nfunction of what happens versus what's\npriced it's just a slow burn of\ndeflation as people realize oh okay the\ntech the tech bubbles over you know and\nit gets priced out and those flows move\nand create a realignment in valuations\nthe old economy is back that was what I\nheard from your response to that\nquestion\nit would be very interesting to watch\nover the coming years uh thank you very\nmuch for joining us at real Vision we\nlove the contributions you provide day\nin and day out to the global macro\nCommunity Whitney um so Whitney Baker\nfrom Toad and macro thank you very much\nfor being with us thank you so much\nAndreas it was my pleasure\nwow I guess this was an eye-opener to me\nthis interview\num I've been leaning Long Dollar assets\nfor many years in a row but I've started\nto slowly but surely reshuffle My Views\nwhen it comes to this us out performance\nof the rest of the world in the asset\nmarkets and I think Whitney\nhas a couple of interesting points when\nit comes to this us out performance in\nequity space relative to the rest of the\nworld the us out performance was led by\nthe technology sector and the technology\nsector is not the place to hide\ncurrently as a consequence of first of\nall quantitative tightening\nsticky inflation\nand the globalization so those three\nthings is not a perfect cocktail for\ntechnology and therefore not a perfect\ncocktail for the U.S Equity Market\nrelative to the rest of the world and\nsecondly we see interesting moves in\ngeopolitics supporting\na slightly more multi-polar World which\ncould be of importance to some of the\nemerging markets that could actually\nbenefit from a multi-polite world\num so in essence\nthe U.S outperformance of the rest of\nthe world could be ending as a\nconsequence of deglobalization sticky\ninflation and tidal liquidity conditions\nthank you for watching hey there\nrevolutionaries to join a community\nsharing
